    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A dim sim is a Chinese-Australian dumpling, typically filled with meat and vegetables and either steamed or fried. It's a popular savory snack, especially in Australia, and often found in Chinese restaurants and takeaway shops. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
    <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
    <li>½ bunch cilantro, chopped</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons red curry paste</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon garam masala</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¼ cup water as needed</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons peanut butter</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork, onion, cilantro, red pepper flakes, red curry paste, garam masala, chili powder, onion powder, and garlic powder in a bowl; mix well and set aside.</li>
        <br> <li>Place flour into a separate bowl. Slowly stir in water as needed until a soft dough is achieved; some water may be left over. Roll out walnut-sized balls of dough into thin circles for wrappers.</li>
          <br><li>Fill each wrapper with about 1 tablespoon pork mixture. Moisten the edges of wrapper, then fold in half, sealing to create a half-moon shape. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.</li>
           <br><li>Place dumplings in a steamer over 1-inch boiling water and cover. Steam until dough becomes glossy, about 10 minutes.</li>
           <br> <li>Combine peanut butter, cayenne pepper, sugar, and vegetable oil in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl. Cook in the microwave on high for 30 seconds; stir. Serve with dumplings.</li>

    </ol>
